## What is Orion Framework?
Orion is a HTML/CSS/JS framework in the tradition of Bootstrap and Foundation but without any of the bloat. It's a simple, easy to use and quick way of getting your responsive web project off the ground. 

- **SASS Powered** - Choose the column width, number, gutter and padding of a grid system of your choice and SASS will automatically generate all the CSS classes and media query mixins for you.
- **Share Breakpoints** - Manage your media query breakpoints in one file which then automatically filter into both the SASS framework and JS.
- **Build with Gulp** - Orion comes with pre-built Gulp tasks allowing you to compress and concatenate your CSS, JS and image assets automatically.
- **Lean** - Orion comes packaged with just a SASS framework, a few handy mixins and a Gulp setup for building and watching. Meaning you don't have to spend time removing all the guff you know you won't use.

## Getting Started
#### 1) Install Gulp
Orion uses Gulp as it's build system. If you've never used Gulp before, you need to first install its client globally using NPM:

```sh
npm install --global gulp-cli
```

#### 2) Install dependancies
```sh
npm install
```

**That's it!**
