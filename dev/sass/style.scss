// Implements ITCSS (https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture)
// Takes good ideas from inuitcss (https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss)
// Implements BEM (http://getbem.com) and BEMIT (http://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further), OOCSS namespacing (http://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces)

/*
Vendors - 3rd Party CSS files which need to be dropped in.

Settings – used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.

Tools – globally used mixins and functions. It’s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.

Generic – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.

Elements – styling for bare HTML elements. These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.

Objects – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS

Components – specific UI components. This is where majority of our work takes place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components

Utilities – utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class
